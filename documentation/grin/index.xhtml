<img src="grin_bear.jpg" alt="GRIN" width="271" height="200"/>
<h2>Introduction and Scope</h2>
<p>
GRIN stands for "Graphical Interactivity," and it's also sort of a play on SMIL.
The connection between GRIN and SMIL is very loose.
GRIN does deal with some of the same time-based and
media-centric concerns that are generally associated with SMIL,
but GRIN is really very different.  
GRIN was written to support applications that
are a fusion of procedural Java code and declarative elements - it doesn't
try to be an all-encompassing declarative environment, complete with
scripting.
</p>
<p>
GRIN provides:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some declarative glue to help structure an application</li>
    <li>A synchronization model so you don't have to deal too much
        with multithreading</li>
    <li>A consistent drawing/animation model</li>
    <li>Translation and handling of remote control events</li>
    <li>Some simple presentation elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
GRIN is designed to be 
extended with other presentation elements, including programmatic 
elements, which can be arbitrarily complex - even up to a small video game.  
GRIN really doesn't try
to address the overall control of an application; that's left for
the developer to do in code.  The framework does provide a simple
state machine and timeline that might help structure application
control, but use of this is entirely optional.  It's based on the
Director construct, but a Show can be used without ever
touching any of that.
</p>
<p>
GRIN is intended to be used in highly interactive enhancements for
TV, on GEM platforms like Blu-Ray, MHP and OCAP.  It's mostly meant
for enhancements that are tied to video, though it could certainly
be used when video is not present.  It might be applicable to non-TV 
platforms, too.

<h2>Application Structure</h2>
<p>
An application can be structured like this:
</p>
<pre>
       Component c = ...  the right kind of component
       Show s = new Show();
         ...  initialize s
       AnimationClient[] clients = new AnimationClient[] { show };
       engine = new DirectDrawEngine();
       engine.setFps(24000);
       engine.initClients(clients);
       engine.initialize(this);
       engine.start();

</pre>
<p>
A more complete example can be found in the HelloGrinWorld xlet
in this repository, and setup of the animation framework is described
in the <a href="./animator/">Animation Framework Usage</a> document.
</p>
<p>
If an application gets an expose event, there's a 
<code>repaintFrame()</code> method defined on <code>AnimationEngine</code>
that will do the right thing.  When a remote control or keyboard event
is received that the <code>Show</code> should consider processing,
it can call <code>s.handleRCEvent()</code>.  Image loading an other 
initialization happen automatically in a background thread.
</p>
<h2>Show</h2>
<p>
The center of the GRIN framework is called a "Show."  The central function
of a show is to display a "Feature".  A feature is something that presents
something sensory to the user, like an image, some text, or a sound.
A set of features that are presented together are collected into a "Segment."
A show can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Move from any segment to any other segment in a thread-safe
        manner, without worrying about synchronization.</li>
    <li>Manage initialization, e.g. loading large in-memory objects
        like images and sounds.</li>
    <li>Automatically move to another segment when initialization or an
        animation within the segment finishes.</li>
    <li>Assemble visual elements using a simple text file that
        is parsed when the show is created (usually shortly after
	the application starts).</li>
</ul>
<p>
A show doesn't provide any real control logic or application state.  That's
left to the Director.  Director is just an interface declaration; it has
to be implemented by an application implementing this framework.  Director
is an interface that needs to be implemented by the xlet; it's the show's
"handle" back to the xlet, and can be used by commands within the show
to refer back to the containing xlet, e.g. to call methods.
</p>
<p>
A UML class diagram illustrating the some aspects of the design is given below: 
</p>
<p>
<img src="show_classes.jpg" alt="show classes"/>
</p>
<p>
A show can be assembled from a simple show file.  This file is parsed and
turned into an efficient binary representation that can be quickly loaded
by an xlet.  This text file format is adequate, especially for hand-written
samples, but it's not really designed to be incorporated into a  professional
workflow.  A functional equivalent using XML has been developed by
<a href="http://www.javelindvd.com/">Javelin</a>, and we plan to use
the FX/Script language to express a show file soon.
</p>
<p>
Here's BNF describing the syntax of a show file:
</p>
<pre>
{% capture showbnf %}{% include show.bnf %}{% endcapture %}
{{ showbnf | xml_escape }}
</pre>
<p>
A string can be a sequence of characters delimited by whitespace,
or it can be enclosed in double-quotes, with backslash as an
escape characer if you need double-quote or backslash within a
string.  Strings may contain newlines.
</p>
<p>
A show can include a <code>$include</code> directive that looks like this:
</p>
<pre>

    ...

    $include some_file.txt ;

</pre>
<p>
The string "<code>$include</code>" must not be inside quotation marks, 
but the file name
(like other normal strings) may be.  The included file is searched for on
the search path used for all show assets.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
The entities actually displayed by a director are called
"features."  The GRIN framework provides some simple features,
for images, image sequences, assemblies of a collection of features,
and text.  It also provides support for application-defined
features that can be made a part of the text file describing a
show.
</p>
<p>
<img src="feature_classes.jpg" alt="feature classes"/>
</p>
<h2>Remote Control Handling</h2>
<p>
The GRIN framework can do two things with remote control
keypresses:  It can translate them into an appication-defined
command, or it can use them to select visual elements.  The latter
is done with an AssemblyGridRCHandler instance.  It supports
arrow-key navigation, plus a special case for the colored keys.
When new elements are selected and/or activated, it can (for
example) change the part of an assembly that's activated.  This
can be used to build buttons, while still giving the application
author complete control over the UI appearance.
</p>
<p>
<img src="rc_classes.jpg" alt="remote control handling classes"/>
</p>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>
Commands are used as a glue to bind the framework together.  Actions,
like selecting a segment or a part of a feature assembly are done using
a command.  Events are also sent from a Show to its director using
commands.
</p>
<p>
When a command is executed, it is done in a thread-safe manner.  If
a Scene isn't in a state where it's safe to execute the command,
execution is deferred until it is safe.  One example of a time it's
not safe to execute a command is when a segment is drawing to the screen
(or a screen buffer); if the state of the segment changed in the middle
of drawing, inconsistent results might be drawn.
</p>
<p>
The commands defined by GRIN are illustrated below:
</p>
<p>
<img src="command_classes.jpg" alt="command classes"/>
</p>
<p>
Commands must be "compiled", including application-defined commands.
This really just means turning a command string into an instance of
a subclass of Command.  It should include resolving any references in
the command; this is faster, and it allows errors to be caught more
easily.
</p>
<p>
The show compiler has an innovative feature to conveniently write
commands in Java:  the <code>java_command</code>.  This lets you put a
bit of Java source code in the show file, and have that code get triggered
like any other GRIN command.  Behind the scenes, the GRIN show compiler
generates a single Java class that contains all of these code snippets,
and selection code to execute the right one.  The generated code can
reference the method parameter <code>grinCaller</code> to get a reference
to the Show in which the command was enqueued.
</p>
<h2>Synchronization</h2>
<p>
GRIN has a very simple synchronization model.  The most important
external lock is the lock on the show object.  Everything that might
need to synchronize on the show lock needs to synchronize on it first.
</p>
<p>
Any change to a show's state (or the "show model" if you prefer that
term out of MVC theory) needs to be synchronized on the show.  Further,
changes other than purely visual changes need to be synchronized into the
"frame pump" loop, which is basically:
</p>
<pre>
          for frame 1 to to infinity
	      wait until it's time to display frame
	      update model
	      render show to screen
	  rof
</pre>
<p>
This is facilitated with a command model.  At any time, you can
always call <code>show.runCommand(Command)</code>, from any thread.  This does
not require the show lock; it only synchronizes on the internal lock
used for a queue, so this is very thread-safe and simple.  When you
call <code>runCommand()</code>, it queues the command for later execution,
at the right point in the frame pump loop.
The queue class it uses was even designed so that it will almost never
need to allocate a Java heap object, so don't worry about generating
garbage by using it.
</p>
<p>
As an example of the reliance on commands, consider the method
used to move a show to a new segment, 
<code>show.activateSegment(Segment)</code>.  This works by queueing
up a command to activate the given segment when the frame pump is in
the right state.  By the way, it doesn't allocate a new command object
to do this - again, we're careful about generating heap traffic.
</p>
<h2>Image Mosaics</h2>
<p>
Image loading can take a significant part of the start-up time of
an xlet.  With typical players, it's faster to load one big image
rather than several small images.  Thus, it's a good idea to combine
several images into an "image mosaic".  The GRIN scene graph can use
an image within a mosaic anywhere an image can be used.  At runtime, you 
can use images
within an image mosaic even if you don't use the rest of the GRIN
library, by just using the image classes 
in <code>com.hdcookbook.grin.util</code>.  At compile time, you can combine
images into one or more mosaics by making a special "mosaics" file.
This file is compiled just like a GRIN show file.
</p>
<p>
In your xlet, you might want to have more than one show file.  If you
do this, you might want to have multiple show files pool their images
in one set of mosaics, or you might want to have seperate sets of mosaics.
You can do either with the show compiler <code>GrinCompiler</code>.  If
you want a set of shows to share mosaic defintions, simply compile them
all at the same time, by passing in the different show files on the
command line in one compiler run.  Even if you only have one show file,
you'll probably want to also have a mosaics file, so you can control
the name of the generated mosaics file, and its parameters.  Just pass
the mosaics defintion file on the command line along with the show
files, and <code>GrinCompiler</code> will build up a set of image
mosaics for the show(s) according to the declarations in the mosaics
file.
</p>
<p>
A mosaics file has the following syntax:
</p>
<pre>
{% capture mosaicsbnf %}{% include mosaics.bnf %}{% endcapture %}
{{ mosaicsbnf | xml_escape }}
</pre>
<p>
For brevity, the lower-level syntax elements of the show file are used
in this BNF, and not repeated here.
</p>
<h2>Memory Management and GC</h2>
<p>
As was alluded to above, the GRIN framework tries very hard to avoid
creating unnecessary heap objects.  This should avoid the possibility
of objectionable pauses due to GC.  As is usually the case in any
xlet, it's a good idea to call <code>System.gc()</code> after
initialization, because initialization code tends to generate a lot
of garbage, and if you're going to pause for a bit, initialization is
the time to do it.  For a show, this point comes after parsing the show
file.
</p>
<h2>Animation Loop</h2>
<p>
For the animation loop GRIN relies on the 
<a href="./animator/">Animation Framework</a>
in <code>com.hdcookbook.grin.animator</code>.  A GRIN <code>Show</code>
implements the <code>AnimationClient</code> interface.  Because the
framework's <code>AnimationEngine</code> can support multiple clients
that draw in a defined stacking order, GRIN drawing can appear above or
below drawing down by any other Java code.
</p>
<h2>Programmatically Controlling Show Nodes</h2>
<p>
GRIN is a declarative scene graph, but you can also programmatically
set certain node values.  This, in effect, uses Java code in the way
that scripting languages are commonly used.  When you do this, it's 
very important to observe some strict rules around threading.  In 
the GRIN model, you're only permitted to make changes to show 
nodes with the Show lock held, either from the body of an executing 
command, or from within the method
<code>Director.notifyNextFrame()</code>.
</p>
<p>
An example of changing parameters of show nodes using Java is
in the "Playground" test (xlets/tests/functional/Playground).  See
the show <code>main_show.txt</code> for an example of a scene graph
that's set up to be modified from Java.  This modification is done
in the show file itself (inside a <code>java_command</code>), and in a
method of <code>MainDirector</code> that's invoked from that
<code>java_command</code>.  The <code>java_command</code> is
invoked in every frame, by simply having a repeating timer of length 1.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The x and y position of the center point used for scaling in a
        <code>scaling_model</code>.  A <code>scaling_model</code> can
	be attached to features of type <code>fixed_image</code>, 
	<code>image_sequence</code> or <code>box</code>.</li>
    <li>The x any y scale factor of a <code>scaling_model</code>.</li>
    <li>The x and y offset values int a <code>translator_model</code>
        attached to one or more <code>translator</code> features.</li>
    <li>The text contents of a <code>text</code> feature.</li>
    <li>The AlphaComposite value of a <code>fade</code> feature.</li>
    <li>The currently active sub-feature of an <code>assembly</code>
        feature.  You can change this with either an <code>activate_part</code>
	command or by calling <code>Assembly.setCurrentFeature()</code>
	directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many of the nodes that can be programmed also do linear interpolation with
built-in ranges.  As a rule, if you want to set a value from Java, you can't
also be trying to change it with an active interpolation.  Further, when you
set a value from Java, it stays set to that new value throughout the execution
of the xlet; there is no mechanism to recover the default value set in the
show file.
</p>
<h2>Extending GRIN</h2>
<p>
GRIN was designed to be extended, by adding new feature types and
new remote control handler types.  Adding a new feature does require
that you adhere to some needed structure.  In addition to writing a
runtime class to implement your new feature, you need to write a method
to read instantiate a feature from the GRIN binary file, and you need
to write a Java SE subclass of your feature that knows how to write out
that binary file format.
</p>
<p>
The SE version of your feature can, if you wish, include compile-time
processing.  That is, when the GRIN compiler is run to create a binary
file, the SE subclass of your feature can do any computation you want it
to do.  This can include modifying the scene graph, even by injecting
a new node as the parent of your feature, and making every every node
in the show that referred to your feature refer to this new parent, instead.
In this way, you can declare a new node type in the show file, but implement
your node as a collection of already existing node types.
</p>
<p>
To see an example of adding a feature, see 
<code>xlets/tests/functional/Playground</code>.  As of this writing, this
included three extension features, <code>Arc</code>,
<code>BouncingArc</code> and 
<code>ImageFrame</code>.  In the <code>src</code> directory,
you'll find <code>Arc.java</code> and <code>ImageFrame.java</code>, which
are the runtime support for these features.  In the <code>se_src</code> 
directory, you'll find <code>SEArc.java</code>,
<code>SEBouncingArc.java</code> and 
<code>SEImageFrame.java</code>,
which are the SE versions of these extensions, complete with the
<code>writeInstanceData()</code> methods.  The bouncing arc feature
compiles into an arc under a translation, with a translator model that has
pre-computed bounce coordinates.  You'll also find the
extension parser for these new features, in 
<code>PlaygroundExtensionParser.java</code>.  
</p>
<p>
A more substantive example of a "standard" extension is the media
player, in <code>AuthoringTools/grin/extensions/media</code>.  It's
used in the GrinBunny game in 
<code>xlets/grin_samples/GrinBunny</code>, which can serve as a model
for how to set up the vars.properties file to build in extensions from
multiple sources.
</p>
<h2>Building Notes</h2>
<p>
When you build the javadocs, be sure to copy the directory
<code>com/hdcookbook/grin/docs</code>.  If you build the test
program in com.hdcookbook.grin.test, be sure to include
<code>com/hdcookbook/grin/test/assets</code> in the JAR file.
</p>
<h2>Future Ideas</h2>
<p>
Please see the issues database associated with the
hdcookbook.dev.java.net repository.
</p>
<h2>Launching GRIN</h2>
<p>
A test program for the GRIN framework is provided in the package
<strong>com.hdcookbook.grin.test</strong>.  Please consult the package documentation
for details.  You can launch GRIN using Java SE - this is documented in
the package documentation for <strong>com.hdcookbook.grin.test.bigjdk</strong>.
The <code>GuiGenericMain</code> class there is a nice little tool for
browsing around a show file, and seeing what different segments look
like.  Finally, you can see a pretty complete demonstration of using
GRIN in the xlet in <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.menu</strong>.
</p>
<h2>Note about UML diagrams</h2>
<p>
The UML diagrams were made with a program called <a href="http://www.umlet.com/">"umlet"</a>.
</p>
<h2>Change Log</h2>
<p>
Beginning with version 1.0, only major chages will be captured here.  
For information about the detailed changes in each putback since then, 
please consult the source code repository.

  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.1.4, Jan. 1 2007</strong> fixes a minor bug in Translator</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.1.5, May 3 2007</strong> BSD license update</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.1.6, May 18 2007</strong> Added new (and very cool)
      visual rc handler.  See com.hdcookbook.grin.VisualRCHandler for
      details.  Mouse handling isn't quite done yet, but otherwise it
      works great.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.9, June 18 2007</strong>  Many changes that have not
      been documented yet.  Finalizing hdcookbook for the HD Cookbook
      DVD.  Update coming soon with documentation, but I'm putting this
      one out now to restore hdcookbook.dev.java.net, which just
      changed from CVS to SVN.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.9.1, June 25 2007</strong>  Fleshed out the javadoc
      comments.  Here are some of the major new features introduced
      in version 0.9:
      <ul>
        <li> An automatic image mosaic creator, to speed xlet load times.</li>
	<li> A new "visual" remote control handler that's very powerful
	     and general.</li>
	<li> A feature for fade in/fade out effects, a feature for
	     SRC_OVER graphics-to-graphics blending of features, and
	     one for clipping.</li>
	<li> Good support for xlet feature extensions that modify the
	     behavior of other features.  This is a very powerful
	     technique.</li>
	<li> Some nice additions to "GuiGenereicMain," the show
	     script browser for  big JDK.  It now lets you see
	     the UI composited over a background image when you
	     stop the frame pump, or you take a snapshot.  This is
	     really useful for generating "screenshots" if you're
	     writing a book :-)</li>
	<li> Added <code>Command.deferNextCommands()</code> so that
	     the frame pump can be allowed to catch up after a
	     time-consuming command.</li>
	<li> Many cleanups and documentation improvements</li>
      </ul>
      Version 0.9.1 is very close to what will be on the DVD in the book.
      I know this to be true, because the deadline for getting the disc
      image out is this Friday, in four days.</li>
  <li> <strong>Version 1.0, June 27 2007</strong>  
       <ul>
         <li>Fixed up some bugs in the BDJO
	   and such that were caught for us by a disc verifier.  This is
	   the version going in the book.  I'll archive it to a ZIP file
	   soon.</li>
	 <li>Mosaic maker now reads its asses with java.io.File rather
	     than Class.getResource()</li>
	 <li>Build scripts now work on Windows (using the Unix utils
	     from <a href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a>).</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li> <strong>Version 1.1.0, November 4, 2007</strong>
      Added the animation framework.  Subsequent putbacks will make Show
      take advantage of the optimized drawing that this framework helps enable.</li>
  <li> <strong>Versions after 1.1.0</strong>
       Moved project to subversion repository.  For versions after Nov. 4,
       see the subversion revision log, e.g. with the <code>svn log</code>
       command from the base directory of the repository.</li>
</ul>
